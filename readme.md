# Dojo 1.x + TypeScript

To see it in action, open `index.html`. 

To build things yourself, `npm i -g typescript` and then run `tsc` in the root dir of this repo. To keep things groovy while you're working away, run `tsc --watch` instead.

This uses the [dojo/typings](https://github.com/dojo/typings) repo instead of [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/dojo), as it seems to be better maintained.
